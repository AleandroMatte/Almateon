- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Almateon- My real name is Aleandro Matteoni, i'm a beginner in the programming world, and already chose a career path.
- I love to think in how awesome it is to live in an era where we can make a visually tangible representation of our skill-AKA a software- with most of the things we desire.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finishing my course on C programming and planning to start a course on Java fundamentals, focusing my career in becoming a java back-end developer while
studying to also be able to develop for mobile platforms and expand my knowledge to utilize all of Java's most important frameworks , and maybe learn some kotlin while his popularity is low.
- You can always e-mail me by Aleandromatte@gmail.com, i will try to answer ASAP.
